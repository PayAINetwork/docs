## What is Token Gateway?

Token Gateway lets you accept payments in your own token and grant feature access to token holders. Define membership tiers—Basic, Pro, Platinum—based on wallet holdings, and give your community exclusive access to your app, dapp, or AI agent.

- Accept payments directly in your token
- Create holder-based tiers with configurable thresholds
- Unlock premium features, content, and tools for members
- Works across web apps, onchain dapps, and agent workflows

<Info>
Token Gateway is currently in development. The documentation will be updated as we progress.
