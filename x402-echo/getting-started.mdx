# Getting Started with X402 Echo Merchant

Use the Echo Merchant to validate your <a href="/x402/clients">x402 client</a> in minutes—no server to deploy.

## What you need

- An x402 client implementation (see examples below)
- A private key suitable for the network you’re testing

## Step 1 — Pick a client example

Start from one of the reference clients and run it locally:

- TypeScript: <a href="/x402/clients/typescript/axios">Axios</a>, <a href="/x402/clients/typescript/fetch">Fetch</a>
- Python: <a href="/x402/clients/python/httpx">httpx</a>, <a href="/x402/clients/python/requests">requests</a>

These examples already implement the x402 flow (handling `402`, constructing the Payment Payload, retrying with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, and decoding `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`).

## Step 2 — Point your client at the Echo Merchant

Visit the [Echo Merchant Website](https://x402.payai.network) to see the supported networks and endpoints for the Echo Merchant.

For example:

```
https://x402.payai.network/api/solana-devnet/paid-content
https://x402.payai.network/api/solana-mainnet/paid-content
https://x402.payai.network/api/base/paid-content
https://x402.payai.network/api/base-sepolia/paid-content
```

## Step 3 — Run and observe

Run the client. You should see:
1. Initial `402 Payment Required` response with `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header
2. A retry with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header containing your payment
3. A `200 OK` response with `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing settlement details

The tokens you sent are refunded automatically and PayAI covers the fees.
