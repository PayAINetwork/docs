## Coming soon

This page will explain the benefit of using x402 with your client.

It will go over the architecture of x402, the responsibilities of a client in the x402 ecosystem, and how to get started.

The information here will be useful for adding x402 to your existing client, or for writing custom client middleware to support x402.
