## Why use x402 with your client

x402 standardizes how clients discover payment requirements, construct payment payloads, and complete on-chain payments for HTTP resources. Benefits include:

- Unified handling of `402 Payment Required` across chains and schemes
- Wallet-agnostic payment payload creation
- Predictable retry semantics via the `X-PAYMENT` request header
- Clear UX paths for both verification and settlement outcomes

## Architecture at a glance

![x402 sequence diagram](/images/x402-sequence-diagram.svg)

- Client: Calls protected resources and constructs payment payloads.
- Resource Server: Advertises payment requirements, verifies/settles payments, fulfills requests.
- Facilitator Server (optional): Verifies and/or settles payments for the resource server.
- Blockchain Networks: Execute and confirm payments.

### Payment flow (client perspective)
Steps (1) and (2) are optional if your client already knows the accepted payment details for the resource.

1. Client makes an HTTP request to a resource server.
2. Resource server responds with `402 Payment Required` and a Payment Required Response JSON object in the body.
3. Client selects one of the `paymentRequirements` and creates a Payment Payload according to that scheme.
4. Client retries the HTTP request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing a base64-encoded string of the Payment Payload.
5. Resource server verifies the Payment Payload locally or by POSTing the Payment Payload and Payment Requirements to the facilitator `/verify` endpoint.
6. If verification is valid, the resource server fulfills the request; otherwise it returns `402` with a Payment Required Response JSON object.
7. The resource server settles the payment either directly on-chain or via the facilitator `/settle` endpoint.
8. Facilitator submits the payment to the blockchain and waits for confirmation (when used).
9. Resource server returns `200 OK` with the resource, and an `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing the settlement response as Base64-encoded JSON if execution succeeded.

## Client responsibilities

- Detect `402 Payment Required` responses and parse the Payment Required Response JSON object
- Choose a `paymentRequirements` entry and construct a Payment Payload for the selected scheme and network
- Encode the Payment Payload as base64 and include it in the `X-PAYMENT` request header on retry
- Preserve the original HTTP method, path, and body when retrying with payment
- Handle verification failures gracefully (e.g., offer alternative methods or networks)
- On success, optionally read and surface details from `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (base64 JSON)

## Getting started

1. Pick your transport and wallet libraries for the target network(s).
2. Implement a 402 handler that parses Payment Required Response JSON and guides the user to select a payment option.
3. Build the Payment Payload for the selected scheme/network using your wallet libraries.
4. Retry the request with the `X-PAYMENT` header set to the base64-encoded Payment Payload.
5. Parse `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (if present) for settlement information and update your UI accordingly.
6. Test end-to-end on a testnet supported by x402, then move to mainnet.
