## Why use x402 with your client

x402 standardizes how clients discover payment requirements, construct payment payloads, and complete on-chain payments for HTTP resources. Benefits include:

✅ Customers don't pay network fees.  
✅ Payment settles in < 1 second.  
✅ Universal compatibility -- if it speaks HTTP, it speaks x402.

## Architecture at a glance

![x402 sequence diagram](/images/x402-sequence-diagram.svg)

- **Client (buyer)**: Calls protected resources and constructs payment payloads.
- **Server**: Advertises payment requirements, verifies/settles payments, fulfills requests.
- **Facilitator**: Verifies and/or settles payments for the resource server.
- **Blockchains**: Execute and confirm payments.

## It's this easy

Make x402 payments with just a few lines:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fetch">
```typescript
import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from "x402-fetch";

const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, account);

const response = await fetchWithPayment("https://api.example.com/premium");
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Axios">
```typescript
import { withPaymentInterceptor } from "x402-axios";

const api = withPaymentInterceptor(axios.create({ baseURL }), account);

const response = await api.get("/premium");
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
```python
from x402.clients.httpx import x402HttpxClient

async with x402HttpxClient(account=account, base_url=base_url) as client:
    response = await client.get("/premium")
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
