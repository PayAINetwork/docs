## Getting started with Fetch

Make x402 payments with a Fetch client in 2 minutes.

<Note>You can find the full code for the upstream example at the pinned commit: [examples/typescript/clients/fetch](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/0dfd3e683f1563543bd62a3ad84cbc6851d4054b/examples/typescript/clients/fetch).</Note>

### Step 1: Create a new client from the starter template

```bash
npx @payai/x402-fetch-starter my-first-client
```

The starter mirrors the upstream example and bootstraps a ready-to-run Fetch client.

### Step 2: Configure your environment variables

```bash
cd my-first-client
cp .env-local .env
```

Edit `.env` to set `PRIVATE_KEY`, `RESOURCE_SERVER_URL`, and `ENDPOINT_PATH`.

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the client

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `index.ts` to see how the Fetch client works.

<Check>
  Your client is now making x402 payments!
</Check>

### Step 5: Test the client

You can test payments against a local server by running the [express example](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/typescript/servers/express) or the [hono example](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/typescript/servers/hono) from the x402 repository.  

Just set your environment variables to match your local server, install the dependencies, and run the examples.

<Note>You can also test your client against PayAI's [live Echo Merchant](https://x402.payai.network) for free. You will receive a full refund of any tokens that you send, and PayAI will pay for the network fees.</Note>
